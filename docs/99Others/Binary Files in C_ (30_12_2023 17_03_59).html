<h2>
Introduction</h2>
Using streams for file processing is certainly possible in C++, but most
C++ textbooks do not include any information regarding the full functionality
of streams. This document has been formed to assist students with a background
in C++ and data structures with a full description of the C++ stream library.
The document is based on the GNU CPP library documentation which at times
is not easy to read, especially without examples.
<p>The insertion and extraction operators (i.e.&nbsp;<t>&lt;&lt;</t> and&nbsp;<t>&gt;&gt;</t>
are meant to be used by programs for writing to and reading from text files;
it is assumed that the programmer is familiar with the differences between
these two file formats.
<p>In reality there are dozens of extensions with little documentation
of ordinary text streams. An additional section will be added to this document
at a later time.
<h2>
Basics of File I/O</h2>
Accessing a binary file from a C++ program (by not using the old C functions)
requires firstly attaching a stream variable to the file. The usual stream
classes&nbsp;<t>ofstream</t> (output file stream) and&nbsp;<t>ifstream</t>
(input file stream) are still the types of streams to use. A an additional
type called an&nbsp;<t>fstream</t> is provided which allows for files that
can be written to and read from if this is a desirable property (in the
design of database type programs, this is often the case).
<p>Before any operation can take place on a file, it of course must be
<i>opened</i>,
and when you are finished with the file, it should be closed to avoid loss
of data.
<h2>
Opening a Stream</h2>
The&nbsp;<t>ifstream</t> and&nbsp;<t>ofstream</t> each have member functions
named&nbsp;<t>open</t> which are used to attaching the stream to a physical
filename and opening the file for either reading or writing. The&nbsp;<t>open<t>
member function also provides for a couple of optional arguments that are
not often described. The most general prototype of this function is
<pre>&nbsp; void open(const char *filename[, int mode][, int prot]);</pre>
The format that I've used indicates that the&nbsp;<t>mode</t> and&nbsp;<t>prot</t>
arguments are optional.
<p>The first argument is always the name of the file on the disk that the
stream will be attached to. The&nbsp;<t>const</t> modifier is included
so that a programmer can write the name of the file (inside double quotes)
in the function call. The only tricky part about using the&nbsp;<t>open</t>
member function is under DOS based systems (includes Windows) in which
directories are separated by a \; recall that the backslash character has
a special meaning in C++ strings.
<p>The&nbsp;<t>prot</t> parameter is used to specify the protection (permission)
of the file under multiuser operating systems such as Unix. It allows you
to specify which users are allowed to look at this file. Under DOS/Windows,
this parameter is never used. The&nbsp;<t>mode</t> parameter is usually
left out when dealing with text files, but there are some very useful situations
under binary files for which this parameter must be set. There are a number
of options that can be given for this parameter. If you need to specify
more than one of them simply place a vertical bar between them.
<ul>
<li>
<t>ios::in</t> This indicates that the stream will be used for input. This
may seem redundant for&nbsp;<t>ifstreams</t> which are automatically marked
for input when they are opened, but it has to be used occasionally. When
you call&nbsp;<t>open</t> with no second parameter, the parameter is assumed
to be&nbsp;<t>ios::in</t> but if you give any other parameter such as&nbsp;<t>ios::binary</t>
you will need to specify that the file is an input file as well.</li>
<li>
<t>ios::out</t> This indicates that the stream will be used for output.
Like&nbsp;<t>ios::in</t> this may seem redundant for&nbsp;<t>ofstream</t>s
but for the same reason as above, it usually has to be given.</li>
<li>
<t>ios::ate</t> This causes the file pointer to point&nbsp; <b>at the&nbsp;
end </b>of the file when the file is opened.</li>
<li>
<t>ios::trunc</t> This causes the all the existing data in the file to
be discarded (erased) when the file is opened. Be very careful not to use
this option on a file you do not want destroyed!</li>
<li>
<t>ios::binary</t> This causes the file to be accessed as a binary file. Most
likely you will need to set this option. If you forget to set this option,
many strange problems will occur when reading certain characters like `end
of line' and `end of file'.</li>
</ul>
Example of opening a binary file:
<pre>int main()
{
&nbsp; ifstream infile;
&nbsp; infile.open("hello.dat", ios::binary | ios::in);
// rest of program

}</pre>
<h2>
Writing to a Binary File</h2>
I mentioned once that&nbsp;<t>&lt;&lt;</t> is used to write data to a text
file. If you had a variable&nbsp;<t>x</t> that contained the value 354
and you used the statment&nbsp;<t>outfile &lt;&lt; x;</t> this would cause
the character 3, the character 5, and the character 4 to be written (in
ASCII form) to the file. This is not binary form which would only require
16-bits. The&nbsp;<t>ofstream</t> class provides a member function named&nbsp;<t>write</t>
that allows for information to be written in binary form to the stream.
The prototype of the&nbsp;<t>write</t> function is
<pre>&nbsp; ostream&amp; write(void *buffer, streamsize n);</pre>
This function causes <i>n</i> bytes to be written from the memory location
given by the buffer to the disk and moves the file pointer ahead <i>n</i>
bytes.
<p>The parameters types require a little bit of explanation. Even though
the return type is&nbsp;<t>ofstream&amp;</t> the return value is usually
ignored by most programers. The&nbsp;<t>buffer</t> pointer is of type&nbsp;<t>void</t>
this allows for any type of variable to be used as the first parameter.
You should not be writing functions with&nbsp;<t>void</t> parameters, this
is a very tricky part of programming. The type&nbsp;<t>streamsize</t> is
simply a positive integer.
<p>It is rare that you will know exactly how many bytes a particular variable
is. To obtain this information, C++ provides a macro (its like a function)
named&nbsp;<t>sizeof</t> that takes exactly one parameter and returns the
size of the parameter in terms of bytes required for storage.
<p>Below is an example of using the&nbsp;<t>sizeof</t> macro to obtain
the size of a variable and writing the contents of a variable to disk.
Notice the use of a structure rather than a class; you <b>should not use
this method for writing classes to binary files!</b> See the section entitled
<i>Writing
Classes to Files</i> for a description of how this should be done.
<pre>struct Person
{
&nbsp; char name[50];
&nbsp; int age;
&nbsp; char phone[24];
};

int main()
{
&nbsp; Person me = {"Robert", 28, "364-2534"};
&nbsp; Person book[30];
&nbsp; int x = 123;
&nbsp; double fx = 34.54;
&nbsp; ofstream outfile;
&nbsp; outfile.open("junk.dat", ios::binary | ios::out);
&nbsp; outfile.write(&amp;x, sizeof(int)); // sizeof can take a type
&nbsp; outfile.write(&amp;fx, sizeof(fx)); // or it can take a variable name
&nbsp; outfile.write(&amp;me, sizeof(me));
&nbsp; outfile.write(book, 30*sizeof(Person))
&nbsp; outfile.close();
}</pre>
<h2>
Reading from a Binary File</h2>
Reading data from a binary file is just like writing it except that the
function is now called&nbsp;<t>read</t> instead of&nbsp;<t>write</t> When
reading data from a file there are a couple of new things to watch out
for:
<ul>
<li>
It is the responsibility of the programmer to make sure that the buffer
is large enough to hold all the data that is being read. The following
code segment would probably result in a crash unless the size of a integer
was 7 bytes (unlikely number):</li>
</ul>
<ul>&nbsp; <tt>int main()</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int x;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ifstream infile;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; infile.open("silly.dat", ios::binary | ios::in)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; infile.read(&amp;x, 7); // reads 7 bytes into
a cell that is either 2 or 4</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; }</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
After reading something from the file, the&nbsp;<t>fail()</t> member function
should be called to determine if the operation completed succesfully. In
C++, no file operations cause the program to stop. If an error occurs and
you do not check it, then your program will be running unreliably. See
a section further in this document regarding the detection of errors.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
File Pointer</h2>
<ol>&nbsp;</ol>
Whenever data is read from or writen to a file, the data is put or taken
from a location inside the file described by the <b>file pointer</b>. In
a sequential access file, information is always read from start to end
and every time <i>n</i> bytes is read or written, the file pointer is moved
<i>n</i>
bytes ahead. In a random access file, we are allowed to moved the file
pointer to different locations to read data at various locations within
a file. Think of a database full of store items. When the item is scanned
at the checkout, the barcode is used to look up a description and price
of the item. If the file were sequential access, we would have to start
searching at the beginning of the file which is probably slower than we
would like. This is not a course in file processing, but it suffices to
say that if we could move the file pointer directly to the record containing
the data we would have to read from the file just once.
<p>The&nbsp;<t>tellp()</t> member function has a prototype of the form
<p><tt>streampos tellp();</tt>
<p>This function accepts no parameters, but returns the location given
in bytes from the beginning of the file where the file pointer is currently
sitting. The next read or write will take place from this location.
<p>The&nbsp;<t>seekp()</t> member function has a prototype of the form
<p><tt>void seekp(streampos location, int relative);</tt>
<p>This causes the file pointer to move to another location within the
file. The location specifies the number of bytes that will be used to determine
the location and the&nbsp;<t>relative</t> parameter indicates whether this
is some sort of absolute or relative positioning request. Possible values
for&nbsp;<t>relative</t> are:
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
<t>ios::beg</t> This indicates that the location is the number of bytes
from the beginning of the file.</li>
<li>
<t>ios::cur</t> This indicates that the location is the number of bytes
from the current file pointer location. This allows for a relative positioning
of the file pointer.</li>
<li>
<t>ios::end</t> This indicates that the location is the number of bytes
from the end of the file.</li>
</ol>
We consider an example that uses both obtaining and setting the file pointer
location:
<p><tt>int main()</tt>
<br><tt>{</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; int x;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; streampos pos;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; ifstream infile;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; infile.open("silly.dat", ios::binary | ios::in);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; infile.seekp(243, ios::beg); // move 243 bytes into the
file</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; infile.read(&amp;x, sizeof(x));</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; pos = infile.tellg();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; "The file pointer is now at location " &lt;&lt;
pos &lt;&lt; endl;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; infile.seekp(0,ios::end); // seek to the end of the file</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; infile.seekp(-10, ios::cur); // back up 10 bytes</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; infile.close();</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Writing Classes to Binary Files</h2>
The easiest way to store records in files is to use a<t>struct</t> If you
are keeping track of records in memory structures using classes, then saving
these classes to disk takes a little extra work. You cannot simply use
a&nbsp;<t>write</t> member function and give the address of the object
as the buffer. The reason for this is the presence of member functions.
It would not make sense to save the member functions; these member functions
end up getting saved as memory locations which would cause your computer
to crash if you ever loaded one from disk with an old memory location.
It is possible to write <i>objects</i> to disk but it requires that the
object have a member function associated with it.
<p>My usual approach is to insert a member function named&nbsp;<t>read</t>
and&nbsp;<t>write</t> in each member function. These functions should take
an&nbsp;<t>fstream</t> as a parameter as the stream to save itself to.
Your program should then open the stream and call the member function with
the appropriate stream. The member function should then go through each
data field of the object writing them out in a particular order. The&nbsp;<t>read</t>
member function must retrieve the information from the disk in exactly
the same order.
<p>The example for this section is a little involved, so I've eliminated
the non-file member functions. <tt>\begin{verbatim}</tt>
<br><tt>#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;</tt>
<br><tt>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</tt>
<br><tt>#include &lt;fstream.h&gt;</tt>
<p><tt>class Student</tt>
<br><tt>{</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; private:</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int number;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; char name[50];</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; float gpa;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; public:</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Student(int n, const char *s, float g);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void save(ofstream&amp; of);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void load(ifstream&amp; inf);</tt>
<br><tt>};</tt>
<p><tt>main()</tt>
<br><tt>{</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Student me(11321, "Myself", 4.3);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; ofstream myfile;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; myfile.open("silly.dat", ios::binary | ios::out);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; me.save(myfile);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; myfile.close();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; return(0);</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<p><tt>void Student::save(ofstream&amp; of)</tt>
<br><tt>{</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; of.write(&amp;number, sizeof(number));</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; of.write(name, sizeof(name));</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; of.write(&amp;gpa, sizeof(gpa));</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<p><tt>void Student::load(ifstream&amp; inf)</tt>
<br><tt>{</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; inf.read(&amp;number, sizeof(number));</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; inf.read(name, sizeof(name));</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; inf.read(&amp;gpa, sizeof(gpa));</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
What Went Wrong?</h2>
In this section, I will point out a couple of methods of determining if
a file operation was successful and if not, a couple of methods of determing
roughly what went wrong. After every disk operation, a well written program
will call the member function&nbsp;<t>fail()</t> to see if the operation
completed successfully. It is up to the programmer to determine what should
occur when a file operation goes bad. Essentially there are three possibilities:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Ignore the problem and hope it never happens. This is an okay approach
to dealing with errors for small programs written to test an idea, but
a fully working version of a program should never assume that the user
will not make a mistake.</li>
<li>
If an error occurs, call&nbsp;<t>exit(EXIT_FAILURE);</t> and have the program
terminate. This is slighly better than just hoping it doesn't happen, but
in a full version of a program, this could be a real nuisance to the user.
Think of what would happen if you spent 5 hours typing an essay, then tried
to save it to the&nbsp;<t>T:</t> which did not exist. If your program just
aborted then you would have lost 5 hours of work.</li>
<li>
When an error occurs, let the user try to correct the error and try the
operation again. This is the preferred method as far as the user is concerned,
but is usually not trivial to program. You should try to implement this
as much as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>An unfortunate situation arises when dealing with errors, they are
generally physical things which make them operating system dependent. Next,
I will list the ANSI (the standard) approach to dealing with errors and
the DOS approach to dealing with errors. The ANSI approach is much more
general and therefore the error messages will not be precise, but the ANSI
approach will work no matter which C++ compiler you use. The DOS error
handling eliminates some of the confusion about what happened but obviously
is only good on DOS machines that support the library (Turbo C++, Borland
C++, and GNU G++ support this library). To make things a little uglier,
there appears to be no error support built into streams other than the&nbsp;<t>fail()</t>
function. To combat errors we have to rely on some existing C functions
which are no problem to use from C++ since C++ is simply an extension of
C.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
ANSI Errors</h3>
<ol>ANSI C supports a global variable (oh no, a global variable!) named&nbsp;<t>errno</t>
which can be accessed by including&nbsp;<t>errno.h</t> When errors occur
the variable is set to a standard error code which should be equivalent
on all operating systems. There are too many error codes to bother listing
in this document. Usually the best way to discover all error codes is to
look at the manual page or on-line help searching on the keyword&nbsp;<t>errno</t>
The include file does define a set of constants that can be used to determine
the type of error that occurred. For example, error code 22 indicates that
the file you just tried to open did not exist. A slightly better way to
say 22 is to use the constant ENOENT. There is a function in&nbsp;<t>stdio.h</t>
named&nbsp;<t>perror</t> that takes one string as a parameter. When this
function is called, the string is displayed on the screen followed by a
colon then by a message that describes the value in&nbsp;<t>errno</t> This
can be handy if you do not want to write error handlers and just want the
program to halt. Below is a simple program that reads a filename from the
user, opens the file and displays the fact that the drive was not ready,
the file did not exist or the standard error message.
<p>&nbsp;<tt>main()</tt>
<br><tt>{</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ifstream data; char filename[50];</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; "file to open&gt; ";</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cin.getline(filename, 50); data.open(filename);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (data.fail())</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; switch (errno)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
{</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
case EACCES:</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// this is set if the drive is not ready in DOS</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
cout &lt;&lt; "Drive not ready or permission denied" &lt;&lt; endl;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
break;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
case ENOENT:</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
cout &lt;&lt; "Could not find this file" &lt;&lt; endl;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
break;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
default:</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
perror("opening data file");</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exit(EXIT_FAILURE);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // a real program would
then loop back and ask the user to try again. } ...</tt></p></ol>
<h3>
DOS Extended Errors</h3>
<ol>If you look at the errors given in the ANSI list you will notice that
not many of them are really geared towards DOS; i.e. you don't know for
sure if a sector was bad on a disk or the drive door was left open. This
is because the ANSI standard was more or less defined on UNIX system where
these types of errors are never seen by the users. Most DOS based compilers
provide a couple of functions for acessing the DOS extended error which
usuallt provides a much more accurate description of the error.</ol>
</t></t>
