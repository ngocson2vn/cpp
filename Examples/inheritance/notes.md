In C++, given the following Derived and Base classes:
```C++
#include <iostream>

class Base {
 public:
  virtual void print_data_base() {
    std::cout << "data: " << data_ << std::endl;
  }
 private:
  char* data_;
};

class Derived : public Base {
 public:
  virtual void print_data_derived() {
    std::cout << "data: " << data_ << std::endl;
  }
};
```

Why cannot print_data_derived() access the Base's data_ member?

In C++, the reason `print_data_derived()` in the `Derived` class cannot access the `data_` member of the `Base` class is due to **access control**. Specifically:

1. **`data_` is a `private` member of `Base`**  
   - In the `Base` class, `data_` is declared as `private`.  
   - Private members of a base class are **not accessible** directly by derived classes.
   - This means `Derived` cannot directly access `data_`.

2. **Inheritance and Access Control**  
   - Even though `Derived` inherits `Base` **publicly**, private members of the base class **are not inherited** in a way that allows direct access by derived classes.
   - Private members are only accessible to the **Base class's own member functions**, but not to `Derived` or any other external functions.

### How Can `print_data_base()` Access `data_`?
The `Base` class member function `print_data_base()` can access `data_` because it is a member function of `Base`, and private members are accessible within the same class.

### How to Allow Access in Derived?
If you want `Derived` to access `data_`, you have a few options:

1. **Change `data_` to `protected`**  
   ```cpp
   class Base {
    protected:
      char* data_;  // Now accessible in Derived
   };
   ```
   - `protected` members are accessible to derived classes but still not to external users.

2. **Provide a `protected` or `public` getter method in `Base`**  
   ```cpp
   class Base {
   private:
     char* data_;

   protected:
     char* get_data() { return data_; }
   };
   ```
   - `Derived` can now access `data_` using `get_data()`.

### Conclusion:
`Derived` cannot access `data_` directly because it is `private` in `Base`. Private members are not accessible to derived classes. Changing it to `protected` or providing a getter function would allow access.

But because Derived class publicly inherits from Base class, the method print_data_base() becomes Derived class's method. Why can it still access the data_ member?

Great question! Even though `Derived` **inherits** from `Base`, and `print_data_base()` is a **public virtual method** that `Derived` also has access to, the reason `print_data_base()` can still access `Base`'s private member `data_` is because **methods maintain their original class's access privileges**.

### Key Concept: **Method Access Control Is Based on the Class It Belongs To**
Even though `Derived` inherits `print_data_base()` from `Base`, the function still **belongs to `Base`**. This means:
- `print_data_base()` is allowed to access `Base`'s private members (`data_`) because it is a **member function of `Base`**.
- `Derived` simply **inherits** this method, but it does not change which class the method belongs to.

### Why Can `print_data_base()` Access `data_`, but Not `print_data_derived()`?
1. **`print_data_base()` is a member of `Base`**
   - It has access to `Base`'s private members (like `data_`).
   - Even when called on a `Derived` object, it still runs as a `Base` function.

2. **`print_data_derived()` is a member of `Derived`**
   - It is **not** a `Base` method.
   - Even though `Derived` inherits from `Base`, it **does not inherit access** to `Base`'s `private` membersâ€”only `Base`'s own methods can access them.

### Example: Calling `print_data_base()` from `Derived`
```cpp
Derived d;
d.print_data_base(); // Allowed because it is a Base method
```
- This works because `print_data_base()` still operates **within the context of `Base`**, so it can access `data_`.

### Example: Calling `print_data_derived()`
```cpp
Derived d;
d.print_data_derived(); // ERROR: Cannot access data_
```
- `print_data_derived()` belongs to `Derived`, which **does not have access** to `Base`'s private member `data_`.

### The Key Rule:
- **Methods always follow the access control rules of the class they are originally defined in.**
- Even if a method is inherited, it retains the access privileges of its **own class**, not the derived class.

### How to Fix It?
If you want `Derived` to access `data_`, you can:
1. **Change `data_` from `private` to `protected`** in `Base`:
   ```cpp
   class Base {
   protected:
       char* data_;
   };
   ```
2. **Provide a `protected` or `public` getter method** in `Base`:
   ```cpp
   class Base {
   private:
       char* data_;
   protected:
       char* get_data() { return data_; }
   };
   ```

### Final Answer:
The reason `print_data_base()` can access `data_` while `print_data_derived()` cannot is because `print_data_base()` is **a member of `Base`**, and `Base`'s private members are accessible **only to `Base`'s member functions**. `Derived` inherits the function but **not** the ability to directly access `Base`'s private members.

Could you unpack this phrase "print_data_base() still operates within the context of Base"?

Sure! Let's break down the phrase **"print_data_base() still operates within the context of Base"** and clarify what it means in C++.

---

## **1. What Does "Context of Base" Mean?**
When a function is defined in a class, it **belongs** to that class and follows that class's access control rules, even when called on an object of a derived class.

- `print_data_base()` is **defined in `Base`**, so it operates as a `Base` function.
- This means it has access to **all** members of `Base`, including `private` members like `data_`.
- Even if we call `print_data_base()` on a `Derived` object, the function **is still a `Base` function**.

### Example:
```cpp
Derived d;
d.print_data_base();  // Calls Base::print_data_base()
```
- Even though `d` is of type `Derived`, the function being called is `Base::print_data_base()`.
- The function executes as if it were being called on a `Base` object, **not** a `Derived` object.

---

## **2. Why Does `print_data_base()` Have Access to `data_`?**
Because `print_data_base()` **belongs to `Base`**, it follows `Base`'s access rules.  
This means:
- It can access **private members** of `Base` (`data_`).
- It does not care whether it was called on a `Base` object or a `Derived` objectâ€”it still behaves like a `Base` function.

### Visualizing the Call:
When calling:
```cpp
d.print_data_base();
```
it behaves like:
```cpp
Base::print_data_base();
```
And since `Base::print_data_base()` is inside `Base`, it **can** access `data_`.

---

## **3. Why Can't `print_data_derived()` Access `data_`?**
Now, let's look at `print_data_derived()`:
```cpp
class Derived : public Base {
 public:
  virtual void print_data_derived() {
    std::cout << "data: " << data_ << std::endl;  // ERROR
  }
};
```
- `print_data_derived()` is **not a `Base` function**.
- It is a function **of `Derived`**, and `Derived` does **not** have access to `Base`'s `private` members.
- Even though `Derived` inherits from `Base`, private members of `Base` are **not accessible in `Derived`**.

### Analogy:
Think of `Base` as a house with **private rooms**.  
- `print_data_base()` is a person **inside** the house, so it has access to everything inside (`data_`).  
- `print_data_derived()` is a person **outside** the house (in a separate subclass), and **cannot enter the private rooms**.

---

## **4. Key Rule: A Function Always Follows Its Defining Class's Access Rules**
- A function always **operates under the rules of the class it is defined in**.
- `print_data_base()` is a function of `Base`, so it has access to `Base`'s private members.
- `print_data_derived()` is a function of `Derived`, and `Derived` does **not** have access to `Base`'s private members.

---

## **5. Summary**
- **"print_data_base() operates within the context of Base"** means that, even if it is called on a `Derived` object, it still runs **as a `Base` function**, with access to `Base`'s private members.
- `print_data_derived()` is defined in `Derived`, and since `Derived` does not have access to `Base`'s private members, it cannot access `data_`.
- Inheritance **does not** give direct access to private membersâ€”only `protected` or `public` members are accessible.

Would you like a diagram or code example to illustrate this further? ðŸ˜Š

For the code snippet:
```C++
Derived d;
d.print_data_base();
Does data_ belongs to d object?
```
Yes, the **fully qualified name** of `print_data_base()` is:

```cpp
Base::print_data_base()
```

This is because `print_data_base()` is **defined in** the `Base` class. Even when it is called on an instance of `Derived`, the function **still belongs to `Base`** and follows `Base`'s access rules.

---

## **1. What Does "Fully Qualified Name" Mean?**
The **fully qualified name** of a function refers to specifying the function with its class name to **clarify which class it belongs to**.

- `Base::print_data_base()` means:
  - This function is defined inside `Base`.
  - It is a method of `Base`, not `Derived`.

---

## **2. Calling `print_data_base()` on `Derived`**
Even though `Derived` **inherits** from `Base`, the function **still belongs to `Base`**.

```cpp
Derived d;
d.print_data_base();  // Calls Base::print_data_base()
```
Internally, this is equivalent to:
```cpp
Base::print_data_base();
```
because `print_data_base()` was **not overridden** in `Derived`.

---

## **3. Can We Call It with the Fully Qualified Name?**
Yes! You can explicitly call `Base::print_data_base()` if you access it through a `Base` reference or pointer:

```cpp
Base b;
b.print_data_base();  // Explicitly calling Base::print_data_base()

Derived d;
d.print_data_base();  // Also calls Base::print_data_base()

Base* ptr = &d;
ptr->print_data_base();  // Calls Base::print_data_base() via pointer
```

---

## **4. Does `Derived` Have Its Own `print_data_base()`?**
No, `Derived` **does not define** `print_data_base()`.

However, since `Derived` **inherits** from `Base`, it gains access to `Base::print_data_base()` as a public function. Thatâ€™s why you can call it on `Derived` objects.

---

## **5. What Happens If `Derived` Overrides `print_data_base()`?**
If `Derived` provides its own version of `print_data_base()`, then **that version will be called instead**.

```cpp
class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void print_data_base() override {
        std::cout << "Derived's version of print_data_base()" << std::endl;
    }
};

Derived d;
d.print_data_base();  // Calls Derived::print_data_base()
```
Now, the **fully qualified name** of this overridden function is:

```cpp
Derived::print_data_base()
```
while `Base::print_data_base()` still exists but is **hidden** by the derived version.

If you still want to call `Base`'s version from `Derived`, you can do this explicitly:

```cpp
d.Base::print_data_base();  // Calls Base::print_data_base() explicitly
```

---

## **6. Summary**
âœ… **Yes, the fully qualified name of `print_data_base()` is `Base::print_data_base()`**  
âœ… Even when called on a `Derived` object, it **still belongs to `Base`**  
âœ… If `Derived` overrides `print_data_base()`, then `Derived::print_data_base()` takes priority  
âœ… You can still explicitly call `Base::print_data_base()` using `d.Base::print_data_base();`

Let me know if you need further clarification! ðŸš€
